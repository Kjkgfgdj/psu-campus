# Label Display Improvements

## Summary

Improved the display of labels and descriptions throughout the application with better visual hierarchy and formatting for structured content.

## Problem

Labels containing multiple items with newlines and bullet points were displaying as confusing blocks of text. Example:

**Before:**
```
Third Floor — North wing
• Vice Rector for Academic Affairs & Research
• Vice Rector for Administrate & Financial Affairs
• Services beside the door of Vice Rector for Administrate & Financial Affairs
• Male Toilet beside the door of Vice Rector for Administrate & Financial Affairs
```

This was displayed as a single text block or poorly formatted pills, making it hard to read and understand the structure.

## Solution

### 1. Created Label Parser (`lib/label-parser.ts`)

A utility that intelligently parses structured labels into:
- **Header**: Main title (e.g., "Third Floor")
- **Subtitle**: Secondary info (e.g., "North wing")
- **Items**: List of facilities/locations

```typescript
export type ParsedLabel = {
  header: string;
  subtitle?: string;
  items: string[];
};
```

### 2. Improved FloorMap Dialog (`components/FloorMap.tsx`)

**Before**: Labels were split by separators and displayed as pills

**After**: Clear visual hierarchy
- Large, prominent header
- Subtitle below the header
- Organized list of facilities in a rounded container with:
  - Section heading ("Available Facilities")
  - Bulleted list with proper spacing
  - Consistent typography

### 3. Created FormattedText Component (`components/FormattedText.tsx`)

A reusable component for displaying both simple and structured text:
- Auto-detects structured content (newlines, bullets)
- Supports compact mode for lists/cards (with line clamping)
- Supports expanded mode for detailed views
- Gracefully handles simple text

### 4. Updated Search Results

Applied FormattedText to:
- **PlacesList.tsx**: Place cards in search results
- **AutocompleteSearch.tsx**: Autocomplete dropdown items

## Visual Improvements

### FloorMap Dialog Header

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📹 LOCATION VIDEO                       │
│                                         │
│ Third Floor                     [Large] │
│ North wing                      [Med]   │
│                                         │
│ ┌─ Available Facilities ─────────────┐ │
│ │ • Vice Rector for Academic...      │ │
│ │ • Vice Rector for Administrate...  │ │
│ │ • Services beside the door...      │ │
│ │ • Male Toilet beside the door...   │ │
│ └────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Benefits

1. **Better Readability**: Clear separation between header info and facility lists
2. **Improved Hierarchy**: Visual weight matches information importance
3. **Consistent Design**: All structured text uses the same formatting rules
4. **Accessibility**: Better aria-labels with `getLabelPreview()` for screen readers
5. **Maintainable**: Centralized parsing logic that can be updated once

## Files Changed

- ✨ `lib/label-parser.ts` - New label parsing utilities
- ✨ `components/FormattedText.tsx` - New formatted text component
- 🔄 `components/FloorMap.tsx` - Enhanced dialog with structured display
- 🔄 `components/HomeCampusMap.tsx` - Better tooltip labels
- 🔄 `components/PlacesList.tsx` - FormattedText for descriptions
- 🔄 `components/AutocompleteSearch.tsx` - FormattedText for descriptions

## Testing

To test the improvements:

1. Visit a building page (e.g., `/buildings/104`)
2. Click on any zone with multiple facilities (especially floor 3 zones)
3. Observe the improved dialog layout
4. Check search results and autocomplete for better description formatting

## Future Enhancements

- Add expand/collapse for very long facility lists
- Add icons for different facility types
- Support for additional structured formats (tables, nested lists)
